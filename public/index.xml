      <description>Earlier this year I came across a book titled The Artist&amp;rsquo;s Way. This book outlines a journaling habit and other activities that are intended to unlock your creativity. It calls for writing by hand 750 words each day for a month. You freewrite without stopping &amp;amp; throw away the draft when you&amp;rsquo;re done.
I decided to pick this habit to develop a productive morning routine &amp;amp; keep my head clear and remain focused.</description>

      <title>Customer Success as Product Management</title>

      <description>Product Managers know the importance of customer feedback to iterate and plan a product roadmap. But as a former CSM and team lead, I experienced first hand the huge opportunity lost in not leveraging CSMs as a source of customer &amp;amp; product feedback.
Consider that your team of 3 or 4 CSMs each may have 20-50 clients in their portfolio. That means on any given week they may be speaking with, as a whole, 20+ customers.</description>

      <description>I love this book.
I gained as much from this book as I had from the past three. His writing is simple. He’s impactful and magnetic. He explains topics such as education, work ethic, race relations, reading and studying, opportunity, self-improvement, and meritocracy. It’s inspirational and wise - perhaps the single best book on the topic of success I’ve read.
He rose from being born in slavery to an honorary Harvard Ph.</description>

      <description>Tell less and ask more. Your advice is not as good As you think it is. Michael Bungay Stanier
 I finished this book in the middle of last year. I haven’t read a lot of books on this topic — but this was the most impactful thus far. It provides you the mindset required to be an effective leader and coach of people. It tackles the issues many managers face — creating overdependence, getting overwhelmed and becoming disconnected.</description>

      <description>In 2017 I taught myself to code.
I continued to read articles about courses to help learn full-stack development. As a Project Manager at the time, it was immediately helpful to understand the web and communicate with developers.
I took freecodecamp.com. I learned JavaScript and completed front-end (react) courses. I recommend this fully to anyone working in SaaS or technology. It’s the language of the web. The magic of the internet become something tangible.</description>

      <description>I’ve shipped my latest side project, gardenshq.com, a personal CRM geared around gift giving.
This idea came from my girlfriend who was storing all her contacts and gifts in a google sheet, with no easy way to be 1) notified of upcoming dates 2) saving gifts she found around the web and 3) organizing gifts around holidays and birthdays. She’s a power gifter and she something with more oomph.</description>

      <title>Learning JavaScript: Lessons</title>

      <description>Earlier this I decided to learn JavaScript. Here’s what I’ve learned thus far.
Background:
I ran into an article by Derek Sivers on learning how to program: https://sivers.org/prog.
Then his follow-up article on learning JavaScript. https://sivers.org/learn-js
After running through FreeCodeCamp’s HTML/CSS courses, these articles inspired me to tackle JavaScript. I figured it’d be fun to learn, help me in my current job, and had little downside.
Learning JavaScript
I started with Head First HTML5 Programming.</description>
