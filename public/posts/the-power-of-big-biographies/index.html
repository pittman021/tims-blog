      <p>People shy away from big books. They are intimidating. The thought of being stuck in one book for thousands of pages seems daunting. I don&rsquo;t want to stick with one person for more than a few days, let alone weeks.</p>

<p>But they are underrated as massive compendiums of knowledge on a particular period. It&rsquo;s safe to say that typical big biography - Lincoln, Grant, Ben Franklin, Steve Jobs - are of lives that lasted for 60 - 80 years.</p>

<p>What is misleading about these books is that they are about one person. But in order to tell the person&rsquo;s story, context is required. This is where these books shimmer.</p>

<p>In order to understand the subject, context of the period is required. The backdrop of the period, its value, opinions, and narratives that support the growth of the subject are needed.</p>

<p>As a result you&rsquo;ll walk away with a very solid foundation into 60 to 80 years of a time period and the context in which it is presented. For this I really enjoy the presidential biographies - my favorites have been Grant, The Rise of Teddy Roosevelt, and (most likely, not finished) Washington. Since presidents wield such immense power, they cast a wide range, requiring the author to provide greater context.</p>

<p>So, pick up a biography.  Get through the low parts. They will come. But while others put the book down because it&rsquo;s too difficult, you&rsquo;ll enjoy benefits.</p>
