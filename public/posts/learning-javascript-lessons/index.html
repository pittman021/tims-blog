      <p>Earlier this I decided to learn JavaScript. Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve learned thus far.</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>I ran into an article by Derek Sivers on learning how to program:Â <a href="https://sivers.org/prog">https://sivers.org/prog</a>.</p>

<p>Then his follow-up article on learning JavaScript.Â <a href="https://sivers.org/learn-js">https://sivers.org/learn-js</a></p>

<p>After running through FreeCodeCampâ€™s HTML/CSS courses, these articles inspired me to tackle JavaScript. I figured itâ€™d be fun to learn, help me in my current job, and had little downside.</p>

<p><strong>Learning JavaScript</strong></p>

<p>I started with Head First HTML5 Programming.</p>

<p>If you are just staring out, IÂ _highly_Â recommend you go through this book. It very clearly walks you through what JavaScript does, what it can do, and walks you through building little apps along the way. I still use this book as a reference.</p>

<p>The style Head First uses to teach you the basics is invaluable. It creates a conversational style bolstered with side comments, Q/A, fake conversations and metaphors to help the ideas stick.</p>

<p>Derek also recommended FreeCodeCamp.com. So I started there as well. This gives you specific lessons on JavaScript basics. The exercises are a great supplement to Head First as they are interactive and make your brain sweat in a different way that Head First does.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m now about 279 challenges into the Front-End curriculum. Iâ€™ve built several small WebApps as part of the FCC curriculum. And now Iâ€™m working through the Intermediate Algorithm Challenges, which are pretty darned hard. You can view my Codepen here:Â <a href="http://codepen.io/Pittman021/">http://codepen.io/Pittman021/.</a>Â I am most proud of my Twitch.tv &amp; Wikipedia apps.</p>

<p>What did I learn?:</p>

<ul>
<li>I am more valuable to my team</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™ve become the non-technical guy who can troubleshoot CSS and HTML problems. I can speak more fluently with our front-end developers. I can troubleshoot and relay bugs more effectively with my team. And I now understand that there is no â€˜easyâ€™ or â€˜simpleâ€™ solution to dev problems. Some of the simplest tasks building apps took FOREVER to complete because of the smallest and most frustrating reasons.</p>

<p><em>And I now understand that there is no â€˜easyâ€™ or â€˜simpleâ€™ solution to development tasks.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>I am more valuable to my clients</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™ve become more effective at translating business requirements to internal teams and vice versa. Because I better understand how the sausage is made, I better understand limitations of potential features and requests.</p>

<p>I can speak to web developers on client teams now. Need to get some data form our product? Easy, because now I know how to talk JSON now. I know how to use that data to do stuff with it. Itâ€™s very liberating.</p>

<ul>
<li>Iâ€™ve learned to enjoy learning JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<p>I really enjoy learning this. I enjoy the technical aspect of it. My day job requires flexing my soft skills. So Iâ€™ve enjoyed the hard, difficult, frustrating process of learning something more technical like coding.</p>

<p>I love digging and digging and digging until I come out of the other side with more understanding. Iâ€™m still a novice, but Iâ€™m learning everyday.</p>

<ul>
<li>Iâ€™ve been reminded that I enjoy learning.</li>
</ul>

<p>I forgot how rewarding it is to learn. To really sit down and dig into concepts. When was the last time you sat down and studied something? Youâ€™ll be shocked at how fast going through a book will bring you up to speed and make you feel competent.</p>

<p>I highly recommend you do the same. If you want to do X, but feel you donâ€™t know Y, pick up a book. Photography, coding, writing, copywriting, productivity, etc. Find books/courses/classes/seminars to learn. You wonâ€™t regret it.</p>

<p>What do you want to learn?</p>
